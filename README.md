Thanks for opening up my phase-3 project at Flatiron School, CLI Multi-Lingual Bot.  In this project I explored the chatterbot engine and google translate API to create a command line chat bot.  If you would like to check out my project, follow these steps:
1. fork this repo and clone it to your machine.  
2. Open it up in the terminal (or in your code editor if you want to check out the code).  
3. Open the virtual enviromnent: 
    $ source venv/bin/activate
4. open the file to begin the login in process in the command line:
    $ python CLI_new_user.py
5. create a new user by providing username, password and email.
6. select the language you want the bot to respond in, and start chatting.
